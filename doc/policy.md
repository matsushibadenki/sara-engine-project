### Policy  
・Create as a PyPI library  
・Aim for energy efficiency  
・Do not use backpropagation  
・Do not use matrix operations  
・Do not use GPU  
・Prioritize biologically-inspired design  
・Do not use numpy library(We use Rust + PyO3)  

### Work Policy  
・Prioritize creating SNN versions of features that exist in Transformers

### The Goal  
・Set ACC target at 95%  
・Implemented using python and rust together for high-speed calculation
